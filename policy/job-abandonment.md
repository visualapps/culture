# Job Abandonment

When a team member is absent from work for two consecutive workdays, there is no entry on the availability calendar for time off, and fails to contact his or her supervisor, they can be terminated for job abandonment unless otherwise required by law.

If a manager is unable to reach an employee via email or slack within a 24 hour period they should contact their HR Business Partner. The HR Business partner will access the employee's information to obtain additional contact methods and numbers. The manager and HR Business Partner will create an action plan to make all attempts to contact the employee.
